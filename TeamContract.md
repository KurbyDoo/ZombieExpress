# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions.

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Preparation
* Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

* Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (e.g., lower peer evaluation scores).

### Communication

* We will use Instagram as our primary communication channel.

* Team members will respond to messages within 24 hours on weekdays.

* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive. Such as actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.

### Attendance & Participation
Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur or midterm/test that day.

If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously.

During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and engage in the discussion.

### Decision Making
Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

### Work Quality
All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

Members agree to review each other’s work constructively before submission.

Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.

When submitting Pull Request, you should specify what changes you made and what testing you did.

When reviewing Pull Request, you read the code, address changes and provide comments on code itself.

Awknowledge seem comments adding reply or reacting.

Always rebase before merging when possible.
```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature_branch
git rebase main
```
You may get merge conflicts when rebasing. This will appear in the terminal. You will need to resolve conflicts,
then add your changes. Then run the following command.
```
git rebase --continue
```
If you want to abort.
```
git rebase --abort
```
Sometimes you will make a change that will result in an empty commit, so you need to skip the conflict:
```
git rebase --skip
```


---
## Conflict Resolution
If conflict arises:

The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately with people involved through open discussion.

The team will first attempt to resolve the issue with the team as a whole through open discussion.

If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

---
## Accountability
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

---
If appending this team contract must submit a Pull Request that EVERYBODY approves.
